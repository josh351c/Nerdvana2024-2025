/**
 * Oh boy, quite the mess of code. Documented methods are relevant to an end user.

 * tracing through a number of steps.

 * @implNote NOTE that MacroSequence objects store their steps and state directly. Steps
 * are not automatically re-constructed, so unless you have a proper reset built in when
 * all of them and their dependencies start, you need to construct the sequence once for each
 * time it is started. This is what I currently do. If you are trying to create a shared set of
